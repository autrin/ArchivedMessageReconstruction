# ArchivedMessageReconstruction
To reconstruct/unzip a message archived with a binary-tree based algorithm. The program asks for a single filename at the start, decodes the message in the file and prints it out to the console.
The name of the compressed message file will end in .arch, e.g. “monalisa.arch”.
The file consists of two or three lines: the first one or two lines contain the encoding scheme, and the second or third line contains the archived message.
